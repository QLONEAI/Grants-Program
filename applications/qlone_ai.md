- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
Together we met around November last year. We had a great discussion about IP rights, AR, AI&Blockchain merge and what we could improve. With our experience in web 3 market, vast programming knowledge and know how skills, we decided to make something unique and innovative which you would definitely enjoy to experience.

### Project Details

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
https://docsend.com/view/8qrh7ugx864p2pi3
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

Backend created using Python programming language and Django framework. For database we used Postgresql. And for communication we use Representational State Transfer (REST) standart. Authentification based on bearer tokens. For the frontend we use react native framework and JavaScript language and provide both android and iOS applications.

For image to image model training we use modified version of open source stable diffusion automatic1111. First user in application frontend uploads one example image or selects from offered options. Also selects preferred style. Then submits info data will be sent to backend and then text info passed to GPT-4 trained AI model which generated full extended prompt for nft generator. After this step prompt are tokenized by a CLIP tokenizer, created by Open AI to produce text description. Finally all info is being processed to Depth-to-image and a new images are produced with additional conditioning using a depth map. After this we have nfts images and some predefined meta data for these images. Next all this info are passed to smart contract which are Deployed on Kusama chain. And finally all info about successful nft mint are passed to user.

- An overview of the technology stack to be used

  Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
  Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  Large Language Models (LoRA)
  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  GPT-4 natural language AI model
  Machine learning
  JavaScript
  Python
  PolkaDot SDKs
  PolkaDot PDKs
  Rust

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
https://github.com/QLONEAI

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

- We have a functional app prototype, and multiple AI models and blockchain integrations are already available.
The development team managed to generate our own GAN, RNN AI model prototypes which will be more cost-effective for future sales.

- What your project is not or will not provide or implement

- The project will not develop all AI Models on its own in the first stages of the product, we will use some already polished 3rd party AI models. Such as Stable Diffusion, and Microsoft.

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our FAQ):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance, or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

AI NFT generator is really demanding tool for any blockchain. Polkadot ecosystem could be one of the first blockchain to integrate AI into WEB3 with the help of our team. AI cloning tolls, and generators are useful tools for many businesses and people, we have multiple AI models prepared to merge. Our application will be the first one to offer many AI features that are not available on mobile. In add, our AI models will be available in one infrastructure which will give seamless access to users with no need to transfer through other platforms. 

- Who will benefit from Qlone AI:

Games/Gaming studios, Content/Collection creators, AI users/developers, Customer service, and more...
Expected MAU in the first year:

- 1st month: 500 active users
- 3rd month: 5,000 active users
- 6th month: 10,000 active users
- 12th month: 20,000 active users

Expected token holders in first year:
30,000 
Expected NFT holders in first year:
20,000 

- Vision: 

- One of the leading AI tool providers in WEB3 market, the first application to offer all-in-one AI infrastructure on mobile platforms, one of the first AI NFT generator provider, first platform to offer AR/AI merged cloning with blockchain functionality. Project that generates revenue with 20K-30K MAU in first year.
Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
People from range 16-40, both male and female, living globally with an interest in technologies, WEB3, AI helpful tools, content creation, and business scalability. Businesses like AI providers, Games/Gaming studios, Customer service, Education, and Online marketplaces.



- What need(s) does your project meet?
- 
Problem: 

The current AI market offers limited and non-realistic 2D and 3D avatars, lacking interactivity and personalization using biometric data. Speech avatars cannot be tailored to specific needs, and lack identification. Generating NFT collections is a complex and time-consuming process that requires hiring multiple experts. There is room for improvement in the AI market to create more engaging and personalized experiences.

Solutions:

With the leverage of AR technology, avatars will look more realistic and will be 3D rotatable; they will also have more scalability, export formats, and fewer AI indicators.
Choose from hundreds of pre-made voices, avatars or clone your own. Personal voice cloning is available, along with AR face scanning, which allows users to personalize biometric data for a variety of use cases.

Qlone avatars will have the ability to be trained for specific use cases. The use of the GPT-4 model allows training a one-of-a-kind AI avatar with specific data only for his mind to process.
Qlone users can protect their rights and authenticate their avatars or NFTs using IP and AI technologies. IP rights are respected, allowing users to effectively control and monetize their generated assets.

Qlone AI provides a practical option to generate an NFT collection. Users don't need to worry about hiring graphic designers or developers. The platform will generate asset designs and generate smart contracts automatically.
Platform provides a seamless option to generate collections in a matter of clicks and seconds with no development time.
Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
Within the scope of the blockchain and AI industries, Qlone does not face any direct competition from other brands. We provide our customers with seamless access to a number of features that are not available in other products. Competitor prices are high also we can compete with our tools which they lack, we can compete with our price and technology options. Simillar projects: Fetch.AI, Alethea.AI, Bicasso.
